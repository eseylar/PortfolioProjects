## 8 Week SQL Challenge

Created by Data Scientist Danny Ma, the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/) is a set of 8 data-driven business intellegence problems. Each "week" features a different business case-study with a set of direct or indirect questions that can be solved through data analysis. Each case study features one or more relational databases that must be queried for solutions. SQL skills used range from beginner (SELECT, ORDER BY, WHERE, etc.) to intermediate (CTEs, window functions, JOINs, etc.)
