### Data Visualization Using Looker Studio

**The fifth and final element of this exploratory daya analysis was to generate an interactive, coherent, and visually-appealing data viz using Google's Looker Studio.**

On Google's Looker Studio platform, I pulled in my data directly from my SQL tables housed in Google's Big Query Wearhouse. Taking advantage of Looker Studio's numerous graphing tools, I generated several data visualizations that best represent the findings from my data exploration. These include number "callouts", pie charts, scatter plots with informational pop-ups, and interactive maps that change data based on the state or region selected. 

This data viz can be accessed and interacted with [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0825ca82-a91d-494f-870e-c38f525b47f4/page/idZDD). A flattened PDF version (read: no interactivity) can be found in the file [What's_in_a_top_College.pdf]([PortfolioProjects/TopCollegesAnalysis/DataVisualization/What's_in_a_top_College.pdf](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/DataVisualization/What's_in_a_top_College.pdf).
