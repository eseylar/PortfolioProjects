### Data Visualization Using Looker Studio

**The fifth and final element of this exploratory data analysis was to generate an interactive, coherent, and visually-appealing data viz using Google's Looker Studio.**

On Google's Looker Studio platform, I pulled in my data directly from my SQL tables housed in Google's Big Query Warehouse. Taking advantage of Looker Studio's numerous graphing tools, I generated several data visualizations that best represent the findings from my data exploration. These include number "callouts", pie charts, scatter plots with informational pop-ups, and interactive maps that change data based on the state or region selected.
