## Analyzing and Exploring the Data Using Python

**The fourth element of this exploratory data analysis was to explore, analyze, summarize, and plot data in Python, using the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.**

After [exploring the data in SQL](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/SQLDataExploration), I returned to Python to utilize its data analytics libraries for a more robust analysis. Using the file [cleaned_top_250_colleges.csv](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/PythonDataAnalysis/cleaned_top_250_colleges.csv) (cleaned during the [SQL Data Cleaning](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/SQLDataCleaning) portion of this project), I performed analysis within Google Colab Jupyter Notebook again.

I engaged in a variety of analytical processes during this phase, all of which can be viewed in my Jupyter Notebook, [Python_Data_Analysis_Niche_2023_Best_Colleges_in_America.ipynb](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/PythonDataAnalysis/Python_Data_Analysis_Niche_2023_Best_Colleges_in_America.ipynb). Some steps may be redundant when viewed in tandem with my [SQL Data Exploration](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/SQLDataExploration) and my [Data Visualization](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/DataVisualization) in Google Looker Studio; nonetheless, the presence of these data processes here demonstrate my ability to use Python as a powerful tool for analytics. The attached Jupyter Notebook includes the scripts I used for analysis, comments explaining elements of my code, plain text blocks providing analysis, and embedded tables and charts.

Using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, I generated a number of data visualizations. These include bar graphs comparing the ranking, acceptance rate, and SAT scores of the regions of the US, scatter plots with trend lines measuring the correlation between different data elements, and a correlation matrix that plots the correlation coefficient of different data elements.
