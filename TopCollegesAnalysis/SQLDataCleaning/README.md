## Data Cleaning in SQL

**The second element of this exploratory data analysis was to use SQL to clean the data, add columns, and amend errors.**

Using Google's BigQuery SQL platform, I imported the file [top_250_colleges.csv](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/PythonWebScraping/top_250_colleges.csv) (from the [web-scraping stage](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/PythonWebScraping)) and began cleaning the data.

As most cleaning was performed during the data extraction, the data only required one query to be cleaned. This query can be found in the file [SQL_data_cleaning.md](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/TopCollegesAnalysis/SQLDataCleaning/SQL_data_cleaning.md), which includes both the code used and a written explanation of changes (written in Markdown).
