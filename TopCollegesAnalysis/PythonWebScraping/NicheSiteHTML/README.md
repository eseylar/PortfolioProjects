In this folder are the HTML files saved directly from Niche.com, used for analysis. My functioning web-scraper uses these saved HTML files for data parsing, rather than scraping Niche.com itself, for compatibility issues. The Jupyter Notebook I used for web-scraping, Google Colaboratory, does not natively support the JavaScript-enabled environment necessary to run code on Niche.com. I attempted to utilize the Python Selenium library to no avail. Rather, for the ten pages of data I was scraping, I found it much more effective to download the pages as HTML rather than to move my workflow to another Jupyter notebook. Were I scraping more pages, however, it would likely be more time-effective to switch code environments. 

The site downloaded begins here and moves 'forward' nine more pages: https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-colleges/?page=1
