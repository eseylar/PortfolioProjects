## Data Exploration and Data Analysis Using SQL

### The third step of this exploratory data analysis project was to begin searching for trends within my listening dataset using SQL.

After merging my basic listening data with the metadata provided by MusicBrainz, I imported my full listening dataset back into Google's BigQuery environment, along with the table of track genres.

I began with a broad set of questions that guided my search. This set of questions can be found at the top of SQL data exploration Markdown document (linked below and in this repository). Here is a brief sampling of the types of questions I asked of the data:
- Which tracks, artist, and albums did I listen to _the most number of times_?
- Which tracks, artist, and albums did I listen to _for the most duration of time_?
- During which times of the year, week, and day did I listen to the most and least music?
- Which genres did I stream the most?

⭐️ The queries I used to explore my datasets (as well as comments that explain my process and some analysis) can be found within the file [SQL_data_exploration.md](https://github.com/eseylar/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/2022MusicWrapped/3_SQLAnalysis/SQL_data_exploration.md) on my GitHub repository.

The above Markdown document includes the following: some questions for exploration, the SQL queries I used to determine answers, the results of my queries (as tables), and some brief analysis of the results. I used the results of my SQL data exploration to inform my data visualization.
