## Data Visualization Using Figma's Design Tools

### The final element of this exploratory data analysis project was to create a visualization of my findings in Figma, an interface design tool.

To conclude my "2022 Wrapped" music analysis, I generated a data viz to represent what I learned about my music habits. I choose to use Figma (a designer's tool more than an analyst's tool) over a program like Tableau or PowerBI because I wanted my findings to be highly stylized, a la Spotify's own Wrapped feature. While modern BI tools are excellent for creating live dashboards filled with scalable data, my 2022 listening is a stagnant dataset — it will not change over time. Thus, I opted for Figma, a tool that will give me more designerly flexibility. The result, I believe, is a more artful data viz than could be generated in a BI tool.

⚠️ **NOTE: This data visualization is still a work in progress; this is _not_ a final draft!** ⚠️
The final draft will include an "Inisghts" section to help describe additional data insights from the project. I will also continue to make aesthetic polishes to the piece before it is complete.
